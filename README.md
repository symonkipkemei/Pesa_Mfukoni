<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Pesa Mfukoni</h1>

![Networth](screenshots/net-worth.png)

**Why Pesa Mfukoni**

They say time is money , others say wealth is money compounded over time. It is therefore apparent there is a 
thin line between time and money. When used optimally, this can create wealth and value over time.

To achieve this, the following project looks forward to analyzing not just cash (money) but cash flows (money and time). 
The goal is to have a bigger picture of our financial status as well as the small minute details of where our money is being chanelled to.

The outcome of this project is to make wealth a habit and a lifestyle rather than a dream.

**Hypothesis**

- You do not track your expenses
- You waste unnecessary money on uplanned items/events
- You live a free life or a spontaneous life, tomorrow should take care of itself
- You do not track your investments 
- You are risk averse

**usage**

The programme is able to intuitively :
1. Track every single transaction made and attach information to it.
2. Track your monetary net value.
3. Track all expenditure, business, expenditure accounts .

**Rules of the game**
1. Do mix transactions, document only transactions for the respective accounts ; i.e expenditure accounts should only be for expenditures
3. Keep track of all transaction daily, if not at least/minimum once a week.
