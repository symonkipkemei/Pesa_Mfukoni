## why pesa Mfukoni 
They say time is money , others say wealth is money compounded over time.It is therefore apparent there is a 
thin line between time and money,and when used optimally this can create wealth and value overtime.

To achieve this , the following project looks forward to analyzing not just cash (money) but cash flows (money and time) 
with the goal of optimizing incomes and investments and cutting on expenses at all times.

The outcome of this project is to make wealth a habit and a lifestyle rather than a dream and a one time wish.

start today....  turn one day-to-day one.
